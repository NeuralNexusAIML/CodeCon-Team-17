Inspiration <br>
All our team members have come together to go for this project aiming to learn making a chatbot and our project's theme has come from the thought that having a chatbot which answers all the questions together at a place for a student wanted to join an institution would makes one's perspective much clear and better.

What it does <br>
we have a website where the basic frontend is used to make it look clear to convey what it is.And then we have a chatbot there which is the main part of the website that answers the questions related to CBIT.<br>
How we built it <br>
We have used Dialogflow based chatbot using nlp deployed into a wbsite.<br>
Challenges we ran into <br>
Since this is the first time everyone of us were working with this kind of environment, it was very challenging to learn and procced for evry step.
